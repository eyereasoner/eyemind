// Search certificates: what settles a negation or a collection.
//
// A negation holds when its goal has no solution, and a collection lists
// every solution; no step can show either. A search certificate can. For each
// call the search behind the boundary made, it lists every answer, in search
// order: searched(Call, Answers). For each predicate that forward rules derive
// and the search consulted, it lists every derived fact: derived(Pattern,
// Facts). A table is checked by expanding its call one level against the
// program, as a search would, with every inner call answered by the table of
// that call, so no table vouches for itself and a wrong one shows as a
// disagreement. A listing is checked by its facts' own steps, which show each
// was derived, and by closure: under the listed facts no forward rule derives
// a fact of that predicate the listing leaves out. Nothing is searched for.
//
// The order of derived facts cannot be checked this way, so a collection or
// a once/1 whose answers rest on a listing stays an obligation, and so does a
// boundary whose search reaches rule templates or inspection.
