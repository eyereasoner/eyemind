eyemind is a **JavaScript rule language** with forward and backward reasoning
and checkable proofs. You write facts and rules in plain JavaScript; eyemind
draws conclusions, and every conclusion can come with a proof that a separate
checker verifies against your program. It runs as a command-line program, a
JavaScript library, and a browser application, with no dependencies.

[Guide](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/GUIDE) · [Playground](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/playground/) · [Specification](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/SPEC) · [Conformance](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/conformance/) · [Examples](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/examples/)

The guide shows how to run programs, write rules, check proofs, use the
library and develop eyemind; the playground runs programs in your browser;
the specification defines the language, its canonical text, the proof format
and the C1–C10 checks. The examples are 94 runnable programs, each with a card
deck and saved conclusions, proofs and check reports. The conformance suite
has 1329 cases that test any implementation of the specification through its
command line; run it [in your browser](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/playground/conformance).

```js
fact(type('socrates', 'human'))

implies([type(S, A), subclass_of(A, B)], type(S, B))
query(type(X, Y))
```

```sh
node bin/eyemind.js examples/socrates.js
