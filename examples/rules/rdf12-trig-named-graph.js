// Keeping conclusions inside the collection of data they came from. In RDF,
// the web's standard data model, data is a set of triples (subject,
// predicate, object), and a named graph is a set of triples with a name of
// its own, as written in the TriG file format. Here the family graph says
// Alice is Bob's parent and Bob is Carol's. The rules derive ancestors within
// that graph, one and two generations up, so the program concludes that Alice
// is an ancestor of Bob and of Carol and Bob of Carol, each in the family
// graph. It shows forward rules that carry a graph name through unchanged.
//
// The fourth argument of rdf(S, P, O, Graph) is the graph: iri(Name) for a
// named graph, 'default_graph' for the default one.

const ex = 'https://example.org/'

// A parent is an ancestor, and so is a parent's parent in the same graph.
