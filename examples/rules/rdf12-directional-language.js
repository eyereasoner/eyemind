// Text with a language and a writing direction, as RDF 1.2 allows. (RDF is a
// standard data model that describes things with subject-predicate-object
// statements, here rdf(Subject, Predicate, Object, Graph).) A welcome label is
// given in Arabic, written right to left, and in English, written left to
// right. A display rule turns every label into a display label, so the program
// concludes two display labels, each keeping its language and direction, and
// a screen can lay out each text the right way.
//
// literal(Text, lang(Tag, Direction)) carries the direction 'ltr' or 'rtl';
// a rule that passes the literal on whole cannot lose it.

const ex = 'https://example.org/'

// Every label is also a display label, with its language and direction.
