// Joining data across named graphs. RDF, the web's data format, states facts
// as triples of subject, property and value, and can group them into named
// graphs: collections of triples that have a name (an IRI, a web address) of
// their own, next to one unnamed default graph. Each fact here is
// rdf(Subject, Property, Value, Graph). The default graph says that station 7
// reported the sensor graph, and the sensor graph holds sensor1's temperature
// reading. One forward rule joins the two and concludes, in the default graph,
// that sensor1 was reported by station 7.
//
// It shows that a graph's name is an IRI like any other, so data about a
// graph and data in that graph meet in one rule.

const ex = 'https://example.org/'

// Whoever reported a graph reported every sensor that has a reading in it.
