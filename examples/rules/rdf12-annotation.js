// Recording who said something and when. In RDF, the web's standard data
// model, data is a set of triples (subject, predicate, object), with
// names written as web addresses, iri(...). RDF 1.2 lets a statement be
// annotated: here the triple "Alice's name is Alice" is asserted, and a
// reifier, claim1, a name that stands for that triple through the predicate
// rdf:reifies, records that Carol stated it on 2025-01-15. The program
// concludes the asserted triple together with its reifier and both
// annotations, and would do so only for a triple that is both asserted and
// reified. It shows RDF data as plain terms and a forward rule that joins them.
//
// A typed literal is literal(Text, datatype(IRI)): the date keeps its text
// and its datatype, so it goes back to RDF unchanged.
