## The question

A building has a battery and solar panels, and buys the rest of its
electricity from the grid at a price that changes during the day. For each of
four one-hour slots we know how much power the building needs (its *load*),
how much the sun supplies, and the price per kWh. Each hour the building can
charge the battery, draw on it, or leave it alone.

The battery starts with 2 kWh, holds at most 4 kWh, must never drop below a
1 kWh reserve, and must end the day with at least the 2 kWh it started with.
It charges or discharges at most 2 kW. The grid supplies at most 3 kW, and
nothing can be sold back to it. The battery loses no energy.

**What is the cheapest schedule that respects every limit?**

---

## What we tell eyemind

The limits and the four slots are facts:

```js
fact(capacity_kwh(4), reserve_kwh(1), power_limit_kw(2), grid_limit_kw(3))
fact(initial_charge_kwh(2), final_charge_kwh(2))
// Battery power choices in kW: negative discharges, positive charges.
fact(actions([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]))
// slot(Index, LoadKw, SolarKw, TariffCentsPerKwh, Hours)
fact(slot(1, 2, 0, 2, 1), slot(2, 4, 1, 8, 1))
fact(slot(3, 1, 3, 2, 1), slot(4, 3, 0, 7, 1))
fact(terminal_slot(5))
```

So slot 2 needs 4 kW, gets 1 kW of sun and costs 8 cents per kWh. Then
three rules do the work (shown in the proof below):

- **`transition`** describes one hour with a chosen battery power, and only
  succeeds when every limit holds:
  next charge = charge + power × hours; grid import = load − solar + power;
  cost = grid import × hours × price.
- **`dispatch_from`** builds a schedule from a slot onwards. For each slot it
  tries each of the five power settings (−2, −1, 0, 1, 2 kW), keeps those
  `transition` allows, and carries on to the next slot. At slot 5, the end,
  the battery must hold at least the final charge.
- Two forward rules then pick the winner:

```js
implies([initial_charge_kwh(Charge), dispatch_from(1, Charge, Plan, Cost)], feasible_dispatch(Plan, Cost))
// A feasible schedule is the best when no feasible schedule costs less.
implied_by(cheaper_dispatch(Cost), [feasible_dispatch(_, Other), lt(Other, Cost)])
implies([feasible_dispatch(Plan, Cost), not(cheaper_dispatch(Cost))], best_dispatch(Plan, Cost))
query(best_dispatch(Plan, Cost))
```

`implies(premise, conclusion)` is a forward rule and `implied_by(head,
body)` a backward rule (*"the head holds if the body holds"*); an array
means *all of these*. Capitalized names are variables, placeholders for any
value. `is`, `add`, `mul`, `lt` (less than), `ge` and `le` (at least, at
most) are **builtins**: arithmetic and comparisons built into eyemind.

`not(cheaper_dispatch(Cost))` holds when eyemind **cannot find** a feasible
schedule that costs less. This is *negation as failure*: concluding
something from the absence of a counterexample.

---

## What eyemind concludes

```js
// Answers: each instance of a query() that holds.
best_dispatch([dispatch(1, 1, 3, 3), dispatch(2, -2, 1, 1), dispatch(3, 2, 0, 3), dispatch(4, -1, 2, 2)], 28)
```

Each `dispatch(slot, battery kW, grid kW, end charge kWh)` is one hour of
the plan:

| Slot | Battery kW | Grid kW | End charge kWh | Cost, cents |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 6 |
| 2 | −2 | 1 | 1 | 8 |
| 3 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 0 |
| 4 | −1 | 2 | 2 | 14 |

The unique cheapest feasible plan costs **28 cents**. It charges while
electricity is cheap (slot 1), discharges as far as the reserve allows when
it is dearest (slot 2), and discharges again in the last expensive slot,
ending with exactly the required 2 kWh.

---

## Why solar changes the choices

Slot 3 supplies 3 kW of solar against 1 kW of load. Because nothing can be
sold to the grid, the battery must take the remaining 2 kW: grid import is
1 − 3 + 2 = 0, the only setting that is not negative. That free energy then
reduces imports in the final, expensive slot.

`eyemind --proof` writes down how it reached the answer. The

has 182 steps and a search certificate. Below are its claim, its clauses,
the complete 77 steps behind the chosen schedule, and the start of the

It has four parts:

- **The claim**: the best schedule and its cost.
- **The clauses**: the facts and rules the steps cite, numbered by their
  position in the program. The facts listed together in one `fact(...)` get
  one number each. Clause 19, the `cheaper_dispatch` rule, is not cited:
  it is only used inside the absence, step 77.
- **The steps**: one per thing established. A step reads
  `step(what, justified by, with which values, using what)`. A `'builtin'`
  step is a calculation or comparison the checker redoes itself. An
  `'absent'` step is concluded because something could **not** be found.
- **The search certificate**: what eyemind found while it looked for a
  cheaper schedule, written down so the checker can verify step 77.

Read the steps as sentences:

1. *This schedule, at 28 cents, is the best* — by rule 20, because it is
   feasible (step 2) and no cheaper feasible schedule exists (step 77).
2. *The schedule is feasible* — by rule 18, because the battery starts with
   2 kWh (step 3) and a schedule from slot 1 with 2 kWh costs 28 (step 4).
3. *The battery starts with 2 kWh* — fact 5.
4. *From slot 1 with 2 kWh, the schedule costs 28* — by rule 17, choosing
   1 kW, with an own cost `Own` = 6 and the rest of the schedule costing
   `Future` = 22; it uses steps 5, 6, 7, 11, 25 and 26, and the sum
   6 + 22 = 28 (step 76).
5. *Slot 1 has load 2, no sun, price 2, 1 hour* — fact 8.
6. *The power choices are −2, −1, 0, 1, 2* — fact 7.
7. –10. *1 is one of the choices* — by rules 14 and 13: `member` walks down
   the list (−2, −1, 0) until it reaches 1.
11. *Charging 1 kW in slot 1 is allowed: end charge 3, grid 3, cost 6* — by
    rule 15, using steps 12–24.
12. –14. *2 + 1 × 1 = 3* (end charge), *2 − 0 + 1 = 3* (grid import),
    *3 × 1 × 2 = 6* (cost) — builtins.
15. –18. *The reserve is 1, the capacity 4, the grid limit 3, the power
    limit 2* — facts 2, 1, 4 and 3.
19. –24. *3 ≥ 1, 3 ≤ 4* (charge within reserve and capacity), *3 ≥ 0,
    3 ≤ 3* (grid import not negative and within its limit), *|1| = 1,
    1 ≤ 2* (power within its limit) — builtins.
25. *1 + 1 = 2* — builtin: the next slot is slot 2.
26. *From slot 2 with 3 kWh, the rest costs 22* — by rule 17, choosing
    −2 kW, own cost 8, future 14.

Steps 27–39 justify slot 2 exactly as steps 5–25 did slot 1 (now −2 is the
first choice in the list, so `member` takes one step). Steps 40–54 do slot 3
(power 2, grid 0, cost 0) and steps 55–68 slot 4 (power −1, grid 2, cost 14).
A comparison already proved is not repeated: slot 3 reuses `le(2, 2)` from
step 38, and slot 4 reuses `le(1, 2)` from step 24, so their lists are a
little shorter.

69. *From slot 5 with 2 kWh, the empty rest of the schedule costs 0* — by
    rule 16, because slot 5 is the end (fact 12, step 70), the required final
    charge is 2 (fact 6, step 71), the capacity is 4 (step 16 reused), and
    2 ≥ 2 and 2 ≤ 4 (step 72, and step 64 reused).
73. –76. *14 + 0 = 14, 0 + 14 = 14, 8 + 14 = 22, 6 + 22 = 28* — builtins:
    adding the costs back up, from the last slot to the first.
77. *No feasible schedule costs less than 28* — `'absent'`: eyemind searched
    for a cheaper one and found none. This step uses nothing; the search
    certificate backs it.

The remaining 105 steps prove the other 11 feasible schedules, in the same
way as steps 4 to 76. No answer needs them; they are there because the
certificate relies on them. Its lines read:

- `derived(feasible_dispatch(A, B), [...])`: every feasible schedule the
  forward rule derived, 12 in all, with its cost. The cheapest costs 28.
- `searched(cheaper_dispatch(28), [])`: the search for a schedule cheaper
  than 28 found none.
- the other `searched` lines record the calls behind the schedules: every
  `dispatch_from` from each slot and charge, and the power settings
  `member` offers.

## Checked: what the report says

A proof is only worth something if someone else can check it. `eyemind -c`
generates the proof and checks it against the program; `--check-proof` checks
a saved proof. The checker never reasons by itself: it only confirms each step
against the program. This is the complete report:

```js
// Checked answers: these follow from the input program.
best_dispatch([dispatch(1, 1, 3, 3), dispatch(2, -2, 1, 1), dispatch(3, 2, 0, 3), dispatch(4, -1, 2, 2)], 28)

// C1-C10: resolution, acyclicity, justification, coverage, re-decision,
// boundary consistency, relevance, witness integrity, search closure and call fidelity.
condition('C1', 'resolution', 'ok', 92)
condition('C2', 'well_founded', 'ok', 182)
condition('C3', 'justification', 'ok', 182)
condition('C4', 'coverage', 'ok', 500)
condition('C5', 're_decision', 'ok', 89)
condition('C6', 'boundary_consistency', 'ok', 0)
condition('C7', 'relevance', 'ok', 183)
condition('C8', 'witness_integrity', 'ok', 0)
condition('C9', 'search_closure', 'ok', 1)
condition('C10', 'call_fidelity', 'ok', 2)

// Proof statistics: recorded steps and how they were checked.
steps(182)
verified(92)
recomputed(89)
composed(0)
trusted(0)
claims(1)

// This verdict also establishes that the claims above are every answer of the original questions.
verdict('checked')
```

Each `condition` line names a check, says `'ok'`, and counts what it looked
at:

- **C1 resolution (92)**: the 92 steps that cite a program line really are
  instances of it, with the values shown. In the chosen schedule's 77 steps
  that is 35: 12 facts, 12 `member` steps, 4 `transition` steps, 5
  `dispatch_from` steps, and one use each of rules 18 and 20.
- **C2 well-founded (182)**: none of the 182 steps depends on itself, even
  indirectly.
- **C3 justification (182)**: every step says how it was justified, in a
  form the checker understands.
- **C4 coverage (500)**: the 1 claim and the 499 things the steps use are
  each backed by a step: nothing is taken for granted silently.
- **C5 re-decision (89)**: the checker **recomputed** all 89 builtin steps,
  every addition, multiplication and limit comparison, and got the same
  results.
- **C6 boundary consistency (0)**: no boundary was left to the evidence:
  C9 settled the only absence.
- **C7 relevance (183)**: the 1 claim answers the query, and all 182 steps
  serve it.
- **C8 witness integrity (0)**: no rule invented a new, unnamed thing.
- **C9 search closure (1)**: the one absence, *"no cheaper feasible
  schedule"*, was settled by the search certificate, as explained below.

*No feasible schedule under these rules costs less than 28* is not taken
on trust. The checker expands `cheaper_dispatch(28)` one level against the
program, as a search would, without searching itself: the rule asks for a
feasible schedule whose cost is less than 28. Feasible schedules come from
a forward rule, so they are read from the `derived` listing, and none of
its 12 costs is below 28. The listing itself is accepted because each
listed schedule has its own steps and, given the certificate's `searched`
lines, the forward rule derives no schedule the listing leaves out. A
cheaper schedule hidden from the certificate would show up as a
disagreement. The claim is limited to this program: the five power
settings, whole hours, and the stated limits.

The statistics: 182 steps, 92 verified against the program, 89 recomputed
and the absence settled by the certificate, no boundary steps taken on trust. The
verdict is **checked**: the schedule is feasible, costs 28 cents, and is
the cheapest. The model assumes perfect efficiency and ignores battery wear,
forecast uncertainty and changing power within a slot.

C10 certifies the original questions: every claim is an answer, and the
claims are every answer. The verdict is **checked**, also under
`--strict-proof`.

## Try it

```sh
eyemind examples/battery-dispatch.js
eyemind --proof examples/battery-dispatch.js
```

Raise the final required charge from 2 to 4 kWh: the battery must refill,
and the best plan now costs 43 cents. Lowering that requirement to 1 gives
more room to discharge at the end: slot 4 discharges 2 kW instead of 1, and
the cost drops to 21 cents.

## Takeaway

"Cheapest" is a claim about every other option, not only the chosen one.
The proof shows the chosen schedule meets every limit, and records the
search behind "nothing cheaper exists" so that the checker can confirm it.
