## The question

"Parent of" and "child of" are two sides of the same relationship: if Alice
is Bob's parent, then Bob is Alice's child. Such a pair is called an
*inverse* pair. We tell eyemind that the two relations are inverses, and that
Alice is Bob's parent. We never say that Bob is Alice's child.

**Can eyemind turn the inverse pair into a rule of its own, and use it to
find out who Bob's parent is?**

---

## What we tell eyemind

```js
fact(inv_of('parentOf', 'childOf'))
fact(t('alice', 'parentOf', 'bob'))

// For each pair of inverse relations, a rule that reverses one into the other.
implies(inv_of(P, Q),
  implied_by(t(X, Q, Y), t(Y, P, X)))

// A child has its parent as a parent.
implies(t(X, 'childOf', Y), t(X, 'hasParent', Y))
```

- `fact(…)` states something plainly true. `t(subject, relation, object)` is
  a simple sentence: `t('alice', 'parentOf', 'bob')` reads *Alice is parent
  of Bob*.
- Capitalized names such as `P`, `Q`, `X` and `Y` are variables: placeholders
  that take whatever values make the rule fit.
- `implies(condition, conclusion)` is a **forward rule**: whenever the
  condition holds, eyemind adds the conclusion.
- `implied_by(conclusion, condition)` is a **backward rule**: a definition
  that eyemind consults only when a question needs it.

The first rule is special: its conclusion is itself a backward rule. It reads
*for every inverse pair P and Q, X stands in relation Q to Y whenever Y
stands in relation P to X*. `P` and `Q` are filled in from the inverse pair
when the outer rule fires; `X` and `Y` appear only inside the new rule, so
they stay free and can stand for any two people each time it answers a
question.

The last rule says: *if X is a child of Y, then X has Y as a parent*.

---

## What eyemind concludes

```js
// Conclusions: the facts the program derives, in the order derived.
t('bob', 'hasParent', 'alice')
```

The first line is a comment saying what follows. The one conclusion is that
Bob has Alice as a parent. To reach it, the last rule had to ask *is Bob a
child of anyone?* No fact says so; the backward rule made from the inverse
pair answered it by turning *Alice is parent of Bob* around.

---

## How eyemind reads the rule inside a rule

Before reasoning starts, eyemind compiles the potential backward rule as
rule 5 and checks all its dependencies. Its certificate body includes the
outer premise:

```js
implies(inv_of(P, Q), implied_by(t(X, Q, Y), t(Y, P, X))) // rule 3
implied_by(t(X, Q, Y), [inv_of(P, Q), t(Y, P, X)])        // rule 5
```

The inverse-pair fact supplies the captures `P = parentOf` and `Q = childOf`.
The resulting rule instance answers childOf questions; `X` and `Y` stay fresh
for each call. It searches its own body, not the generating condition again.
The proof cites the inverse-pair fact and the parent triple directly, without
an intermediate enabling fact. All potential rules and their generator
dependencies are analyzed before negation or collection is evaluated.

---

## The proof, line by line

`eyemind --proof` writes down how it reached each conclusion. This is the
complete proof:

```js
// Conclusions: the facts the program derives, in the order derived.
t('bob', 'hasParent', 'alice')

// Clauses: the program clauses the steps cite, by clause number.
clause(1, fact(inv_of('parentOf', 'childOf')))
clause(2, fact(t('alice', 'parentOf', 'bob')))
clause(3, implies(inv_of(P, Q), implied_by(t(X, Q, Y), t(Y, P, X))))
clause(4, implies(t(X, 'childOf', Y), t(X, 'hasParent', Y)))
clause(5, implied_by(t(X, Q, Y), [inv_of(P, Q), t(Y, P, X)]))

// Steps: each goal, what justifies it (a clause, a builtin, a control, an
// absence or a collection), the bindings and the goals it uses.
step(t('bob', 'hasParent', 'alice'), clause(4), {X: 'bob', Y: 'alice'}, [t('bob', 'childOf', 'alice')])
step(t('bob', 'childOf', 'alice'), clause(5), {X: 'bob', Q: 'childOf', Y: 'alice', P: 'parentOf'}, [inv_of('parentOf', 'childOf'), t('alice', 'parentOf', 'bob')])
step(inv_of('parentOf', 'childOf'), clause(1), {}, [])
step(t('alice', 'parentOf', 'bob'), clause(2), {}, [])

// Search certificate: derived facts and complete answers used to check
// negations, collections and the original questions.
derived(t(A, B, C), [t('bob', 'hasParent', 'alice')])
called(t(A, 'hasParent', B), [t('bob', 'hasParent', 'alice')])
called(t(C, 'childOf', D), [t('bob', 'childOf', 'alice')])
called(t(E, 'parentOf', F), [t('alice', 'parentOf', 'bob')])
```

It has three parts:

- **The claim**: the conclusion the proof is about.
- **The clauses**: the program's two facts and three rules, numbered as
  above, with the rule inside a rule already rewritten.
- **The steps**: one per thing established. A step reads
  `step(what, by which clause, with which values, using what)`.

Read the steps as sentences:

1. *Bob has Alice as a parent* — by rule 4, because Bob is a child of Alice.
2. *Bob is a child of Alice* — by rule 5, because parentOf and childOf are
   inverses and Alice is parent of Bob.
3. *parentOf and childOf are inverses* — fact 1; it uses nothing.
4. *Alice is parent of Bob* — fact 2; it uses nothing.

The creating condition and the backward rule's own premise are both direct
uses of rule 5's step. The checker verifies them against the source program.

## Checked: what the report says

A proof is only worth something if someone else can check it. `eyemind -c`
generates the proof and checks it against the program; `--check-proof` checks
a saved proof. The checker never reasons by itself: it only confirms each step
against the program. This is the complete report:

```js
// Checked answers: these follow from the input program.
t('bob', 'hasParent', 'alice')

// C1-C10: resolution, acyclicity, justification, coverage, re-decision,
// boundary consistency, relevance, witness integrity, search closure and call fidelity.
condition('C1', 'resolution', 'ok', 4)
condition('C2', 'well_founded', 'ok', 4)
condition('C3', 'justification', 'ok', 4)
condition('C4', 'coverage', 'ok', 4)
condition('C5', 're_decision', 'ok', 0)
condition('C6', 'boundary_consistency', 'ok', 0)
condition('C7', 'relevance', 'ok', 5)
condition('C8', 'witness_integrity', 'ok', 0)
condition('C9', 'search_closure', 'ok', 0)
condition('C10', 'call_fidelity', 'ok', 2)

// Proof statistics: recorded steps and how they were checked.
steps(4)
verified(4)
recomputed(0)
composed(0)
trusted(0)
claims(1)

// This verdict also establishes that the claims above are every answer of the original questions.
verdict('checked')
```

Each condition reports what the checker verified:

- **C1 resolution (4)**: each rule or fact step matches the compiled
  source clause, including every generating premise.
- **C2 well-foundedness (4)**: no step depends on itself.
- **C3 justification (4)**: each step uses a recognized justification.
- **C4 coverage (4)**: all 1 claims and 3 premise uses have evidence.
- **C5 re-decision (0)**: there are no primitive calculations to repeat.
- **C6 boundary consistency (0)**: no absence or collection is taken on trust.
- **C7 relevance (5)**: the 1 claims answer the program and all 4 steps
  serve those claims.
- **C8 witness integrity (0)**: this example introduces no existential witness.
- **C9 search closure (0)**: there was no absence or collection to
  settle; the search certificate serves the original questions (C10).

The report records 4 steps, 4 verified against program clauses. The verdict is **checked**: the recorded claims follow from the source
program, and they are every answer of the original questions.

C10 checks the original questions through the derived rule's instances:
each instance comes from a solution of its generating premises, so every
claim is an answer and the claims are every answer. The verdict is
**checked**, also under `--strict-proof`.

## Try it

```sh
eyemind examples/derived-backward-rule.js
eyemind --proof examples/derived-backward-rule.js
eyemind -c examples/derived-backward-rule.js
eyemind --check-proof examples/proof/derived-backward-rule.js examples/derived-backward-rule.js
```

Remove the inverse-pair fact: rule 5 is never switched on, nobody is known to
be anyone's child, and eyemind reports no conclusions. Add
`fact(t('alice', 'parentOf', 'carol'))` instead: the same derived rule now
also concludes `t('carol', 'hasParent', 'alice')`.

---

## Takeaway

A rule can teach eyemind a new way to answer questions. The new rule is part
of the program from the start, so every answer it gives comes with steps the
checker can trace back to the rule that created it.
