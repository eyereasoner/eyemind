# A right to the value of personal data

*How such a right fits existing EU law, and how it could become a right of its own.*

## The question

AI systems are trained on, and earn money with, personal data. Do the people
the data is about (the *data subjects*) have a **right to the value** it
creates?

A researcher studying this combines two methods:

- **Legal analysis:** how would such a right fit within existing EU law?
  Which parts of it does the law already provide, fully or in part, and which
  parts does it not provide at all?
- **Policy evaluation:** of several ways to develop the right, which one
  covers what is missing, without treating personal data as a commodity that
  can be sold off (in tension with data protection as a fundamental right,
  art. 8 of the EU Charter), and while giving the data subject a claim of
  their own?

This example writes that research design down as a program, so that every
step from the law to the recommendation can be followed and checked.

**Which parts of the right are missing from existing law, and which way of
developing it meets no objection?**

*It is a model of a research design, with provisions summarized for
illustration, not legal advice.*

## What we tell eyemind

The program starts from a working hypothesis: the right has seven
components.

| Component | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `value_transparency` | knowing that and how one's data creates value, including in AI training |
| `use_control` | deciding on the uses through which one's data creates value |
| `value_mobility` | taking one's data elsewhere, to have value created there |
| `value_recognition` | the law acknowledging that personal data has economic value |
| `collective_exercise` | exercising the right together, through an intermediary |
| `individual_enforcement` | enforcing the right oneself, before a court |
| `value_share` | receiving a share of the value one's data creates |

Nine existing provisions are recorded with the component each anchors, how
far (`'full'` or `'partial'`), and why. Four of them:

```js
['GDPR art. 13-15', 'value_transparency', 'partial',
  'information on purposes and recipients, not on the value created'],
['AI Act art. 53(1)(d)', 'value_transparency', 'partial',
  'a public summary of the content used to train general-purpose AI models, not per data subject'],
['Directive 2019/770 art. 3(1)', 'value_recognition', 'full',
  'personal data recognized as what a consumer may provide in exchange for digital content'],
['GDPR art. 79 and 82', 'individual_enforcement', 'full',
  'a judicial remedy and compensation for the data subject'],
```

Five options for developing the right are listed with the components each
delivers and how it frames the right: extending portability (a *right*), a
data dividend (a *levy*), data ownership (*property*), and an autonomous,
*inalienable right* that delivers all seven. The fifth, interpreting existing
law, is given no components: a rule derives them from the analysis, because
interpretation can only strengthen what the law already anchors.

These tables are plain JavaScript; a short loop turns every row into a fact
such as `fact(anchor('GDPR art. 20', 'value_mobility', 'partial', '…'))`.
Two more facts say which framings give the data subject a claim of their own
(`right`, `inalienable_right`, `property`) and which treat data as a
commodity (`property`).

### The legal analysis, as rules

```js
implies(anchor(P, C, D, W), anchored(C))
implies(anchor(P, C, 'full', W), fully_anchored(C))
implies([component(C, Description), not(anchored(C))], gap(C))

implies(fully_anchored(C), fit(C, 'in existing law'))
implies([anchored(C), not(fully_anchored(C))], fit(C, 'by interpretation'))
implies(gap(C), fit(C, 'needs an autonomous right'))

implies(
  [component(C, Meaning), fit(C, How), findall(P, anchor(P, C, D, W), Provisions)],
  analysis(C, Meaning, How, Provisions),
)
```

`implies(conditions, conclusion)` is a rule: when the conditions hold, the
conclusion holds. Capitalized letters are variables, placeholders each use of
a rule fills in: `C` a component, `P` a provision, `D` a degree, `W` a
reason. In words: a component with any anchoring provision is *anchored*;
with a `'full'` one, *fully anchored*. A component with no anchor at all is a
**gap**. Fully anchored means it is already *in existing law*; anchored only
in part, it can be developed *by interpretation*; a gap *needs an autonomous
right*.

Two features do the work:

- `not(...)` holds when eyemind cannot find what is inside it: "no provision
  anchors this component". eyemind only asks such a question after it has
  derived everything that could answer it.
- `findall(P, anchor(P, C, D, W), Provisions)` **collects** into the list
  `Provisions` every provision `P` that anchors component `C`.

### The policy evaluation, as rules

```js
implies(anchored(C), delivers('interpret_existing_law', C))

implies([component(C, Meaning), not(fully_anchored(C))], needs_development(C))
implies([option(O, F), needs_development(C), not(delivers(O, C))], objection(O, unaddressed(C)))
implies([option(O, F), commodifies(F)], objection(O, 'treats personal data as a commodity'))
implies(
  [option(O, F), not(own_claim(F))],
  objection(O, 'gives the data subject no claim of their own'),
)

implies(objection(O, Why), objectionable(O))
implies([option(O, F), not(objectionable(O))], recommended(O))
implies(
  [option(O, F), findall(C, delivers(O, C), Delivered), findall(Why, objection(O, Why), Objections)],
  evaluation(O, Delivered, Objections),
)
```

A component *needs development* unless the law anchors it fully. An option
`O` with framing `F` meets an **objection** for each such component it leaves
undelivered, when its framing treats data as a commodity, or when its framing
gives the data subject no claim of their own. An option with no objection at
all is **recommended**. Each evaluation collects what an option delivers and
the objections it meets.

## What eyemind concludes

```js
// Answers: each instance of a query() that holds.
analysis('value_transparency', 'knowing that and how one\'s data creates value, including in AI training', 'by interpretation', ['GDPR art. 13-15', 'AI Act art. 53(1)(d)'])

analysis('collective_exercise', 'exercising the right together, through an intermediary', 'by interpretation', ['DGA ch. III'])
analysis('individual_enforcement', 'enforcing the right oneself, before a court', 'in existing law', ['GDPR art. 79 and 82'])
analysis('value_share', 'receiving a share of the value one\'s data creates', 'needs an autonomous right', [])
evaluation('interpret_existing_law', ['value_transparency', 'use_control', 'value_mobility', 'value_recognition', 'collective_exercise', 'individual_enforcement'], [unaddressed('value_share')])
evaluation('extend_portability', ['value_mobility', 'value_transparency'], [unaddressed('use_control'), unaddressed('collective_exercise'), unaddressed('value_share')])
evaluation('data_dividend', ['value_share', 'collective_exercise'], [unaddressed('value_transparency'), unaddressed('use_control'), unaddressed('value_mobility'), 'gives the data subject no claim of their own'])
evaluation('data_ownership', ['value_share', 'use_control', 'value_mobility', 'individual_enforcement'], ['treats personal data as a commodity', unaddressed('value_transparency'), unaddressed('collective_exercise')])
evaluation('autonomous_right', ['value_transparency', 'use_control', 'value_mobility', 'value_recognition', 'collective_exercise', 'individual_enforcement', 'value_share'], [])
recommended('autonomous_right')
```

The legal analysis: two components are already **in existing law**
(recognition of value, and individual enforcement), four can be developed
**by interpretation**, and one, **a share of the value**, has no anchor at
all (its list of provisions is empty `[]`), so it **needs an autonomous
right**.

The policy evaluation:

| Option | Objections |
| --- | --- |
| interpret existing law | leaves the value share unaddressed |
| extend portability | leaves use control, collective exercise and the value share unaddressed |
| data dividend | leaves transparency, use control and mobility unaddressed; no claim of the data subject's own |
| data ownership | treats data as a commodity; leaves transparency and collective exercise unaddressed |
| autonomous right | none |

Only the **autonomous right** meets no objection, so it is the one
recommended.

---

## How eyemind justifies "missing" and "all of them"

Two kinds of conclusion cannot be shown by pointing at a fact:

- **An absence**, such as `not(anchored('value_share'))`: *no provision
  anchors the value share*. eyemind concluded it because a search found
  nothing. The proof records such a step as **`'absent'`**.
- **A collected list**, such as the provisions anchoring a component, or the
  objections to an option. eyemind gathered it by searching everything. The
  proof records it as **`'collected'`**.

The checker never searches by itself. Instead the proof ends with a
**search certificate**: `derived(Pattern, Facts)` lists every fact the
forward rules derived for one relation, each with steps of its own, and
`searched(Call, Answers)` records one search with every answer it gave. The
checker verifies each `searched` line by expanding its call one level
against the program, as a search would, answering every inner call from
that call's own line, from the `derived` listings, or from the facts, so
no line vouches for itself. A boundary that passes is **settled**, not
taken on trust.

That settles every absence here, and every list gathered from facts alone,
such as the provisions anchoring a component. It does not settle a list
gathered from facts that forward rules derived, such as an option's
objections: a `findall` list gives its items in the order they were
derived, and that order is not something the checker can confirm. Each such
list stays an **obligation**: a point taken on trust, which anyone may
challenge by showing the missing thing. The checker also confronts every
boundary with the evidence it has, the program's facts and the proof's own
steps: if, say, the program had an `anchor` fact for the value share, the
absence and the empty list would be refuted and the proof rejected.

## The proof, line by line

`eyemind --proof` writes down how it reached each conclusion. The proof has
108 steps and a search certificate, and is too long to show whole ([full file](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eyemind/blob/main/examples/proof/data-value-right.js)).
Below are its claims, all its clauses, and two complete chains: the analysis
of the value share, and the evaluation and recommendation of the autonomous
right, followed by a few lines of the certificate. Comment lines starting
with `// …` mark what is left out:

It has four parts:

- **The claims**: the 13 conclusions the proof is about.
- **The clauses**: the program facts and rules the steps cite, numbered in
  program order (the loops' facts come first, then the rules; the queries
  count too). Many numbers are skipped. Only one anchoring provision per
  component is cited, because one is enough to make it *anchored*; the
  others, such as the AI Act, appear only inside collected lists. The
  `delivers` facts are skipped for the same reason. The objection rules
  (51–54) and the `delivers` rule (49) are cited, by the steps behind the
  search certificate.
- **The steps**: one per thing established. A step reads
  `step(what, justified by, with which values, using what)`.
- **The search certificate**: the facts and searches behind the absences
  and lists, explained in the previous card. For example,
  `searched(anchored('value_share'), [])`: the search for an anchoring of
  the value share found none.

Three kinds of justification occur:

- `clause(N)`: an instance of program clause N, with the values in `{...}`.
  A fact cites itself and uses nothing.
- `'absent'`: concluded because a search found nothing.
- `'collected'`: a list gathered by searching.

In the values, letters such as `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E` stand for "any
value": `findall(A, anchor(A, 'value_share', B, C), [])` reads *the
provisions A that anchor the value share, to any degree B, for any reason C:
none*.

Read the two chains as sentences:

1. *The value share needs an autonomous right, with no provisions* — by rule
   47, because it is a component, its fit is "needs an autonomous right", and
   the collected list of its provisions is empty.
2. *The value share is a component* — fact 7.
3. *Its fit is "needs an autonomous right"* — by rule 46, because it is a
   gap.
4. *The value share is a gap* — by rule 43, because it is a component and
   it is not anchored.
5. *No provision anchors the value share* — absent.
6. *Its provisions are `[]`* — collected.
7. *The autonomous right delivers all seven components and meets no
   objection* — by rule 56, because it is an option framed as an inalienable
   right, the collected list of what it delivers has all seven components,
   and the collected list of its objections is empty.
8. *The autonomous right is an option, framed as an inalienable right* — fact
   29.
9. *What it delivers* — collected.
10. *Its objections: none* — collected.
11. *The autonomous right is recommended* — by rule 55, because it is an
    option and it is not objectionable.
12. *The autonomous right is not objectionable* — absent.

The left-out steps follow the same patterns: for each other component, an
`anchored` or `fully_anchored` step resting on one provision fact, an absence
where the component is not fully anchored, and a collected list of its
provisions; for each other option, its fact and two collected lists.

The last 40 steps answer no question. They prove the facts the certificate
lists, such as each objection: `objection('extend_portability',
unaddressed('use_control'))` holds because use control needs development
and extending portability does not deliver it, an absence of its own. So
every individual objection now has steps. What remains on trust is only
that each option's lists of deliveries and objections are complete, in the
order given.

## Checked: what the report says

A proof is only worth something if someone else can check it. `eyemind -c`
generates the proof and checks it against the program; `--check-proof` checks
a saved proof. The checker never reasons by itself: it only confirms each step
against the program. This is the complete report:

Each `condition` line names a check, says `'ok'`, and counts what it looked
at:

- **C1 resolution (74)**: the 74 steps that cite a clause really are
  instances of it with the values shown; for example, the gap step is rule
  43 with `C` = the value share.
- **C2 well-founded (108)**: none of the 108 steps depends on itself, even
  indirectly.
- **C3 justification (108)**: every step says how it was justified, in a
  form the checker understands.
- **C4 coverage (123)**: the 13 claims and the 110 things the steps use are
  each backed by a step: nothing is taken for granted silently.
- **C5 re-decision (0)**: there is no arithmetic or other built-in
  calculation to recompute.
- **C6 boundary consistency (10)**: the 10 lists C9 left open, of what
  each option delivers and meets as objections, were confronted with the
  program's facts and the proof's steps, and none is contradicted: every
  `delivers` or `objection` the proof shows for an option is in its list.
  `delivers` and `objection` facts are partly or wholly derived by forward
  rules, so these lists stay obligations.
- **C7 relevance (121)**: the 13 claims each answer one of the program's
  queries, and all 108 steps serve a claim.
- **C8 witness integrity (0)**: no rule invents a new, unnamed thing, so
  there is no invented name to verify.
- **C9 search closure (24)**: the search certificate settled 24 of the 34
  boundary steps: the 17 absences, checked against their `searched` lines
  and the `derived` listings, and the 7 lists of anchoring provisions,
  which the checker reads from the `anchor` facts.

The statistics: 108 steps, 74 verified against the program, 24 settled and
10 trusted, none recomputed or composed; 13 claims.

The difference between settled and trusted is plain here. Settled, and so
not obligations: four components are *not fully anchored*, the value share
is *not anchored at all*, the autonomous right is *not objectionable*, each
option leaves the listed components undelivered, and the 7 lists of
provisions per component are complete. The 10 `obligation` lines are the
trusted steps: for each of the five options, the list of what it delivers
and the list of objections it meets are *complete*. Those lists gather
facts that forward rules derived, and the order in which derived facts
arose cannot be checked from the certificate. `'theory_scoped'` means each
is meant relative to this program.

The verdict is **checked with obligations**: every claim follows from the
program, provided those 10 lists hold. As the last comment says,
it also does not establish completeness: it does not say these are all the
conclusions the program has.

`eyemind --unused` lists nothing for this program: every provision,
component and rule makes a difference to some conclusion. Nothing in the
model is decoration.

C10 leaves 12 original-call claims unproved by the available evidence:
those that rest on a collection or a computation. The recommendation of the
autonomous right is confirmed as an answer of the original question, since
its negation is decided by the listed facts alone. The
verdict is **checked with obligations**: the recorded derivations are
conditional on the remaining obligations. `--strict-proof` rejects
them. The report does not establish answer completeness.

## Try it

```sh
eyemind examples/data-value-right.js            # the analysis and the evaluation
eyemind --proof examples/data-value-right.js    # with the proof
eyemind --unused examples/data-value-right.js   # nothing is decoration
```

Or open it in the [playground](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/playground/#example=data-value-right).

Add a provision that anchors `value_share`, even only in part, to the
`ANCHORS` table and run again: the value share now fits "by interpretation",
interpreting existing law delivers all seven components and meets no
objection, and it is recommended next to the autonomous right.

Change `data_ownership`'s framing from `'property'` to `'inalienable_right'`:
the objection "treats personal data as a commodity" disappears, but data
ownership still leaves transparency and collective exercise unaddressed, so
the autonomous right remains the only recommendation.

Legal analysis and policy evaluation become one chain of reasoning, from
each provision to the recommendation. Change an assumption, a provision or a
criterion, and the whole chain follows, with a proof of every step.

## Takeaway

Legal analysis and policy evaluation become one chain of reasoning, from
each provision to the recommendation. Change an assumption, a provision or a
criterion, and the whole chain follows, with a proof of every step.
