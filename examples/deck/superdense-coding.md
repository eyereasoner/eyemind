## The question

A *bit* is a 0 or a 1. Two bits give four possible messages: 0, 1, 2, 3.
Normally, sending two bits means sending two things.

*Superdense coding* is a quantum trick. Alice and Bob each hold one half of a
specially linked (*entangled*) pair of quantum bits, *qubits*. Alice applies
one of four operations to her half, one per message, and hands it to Bob. Bob
measures both halves and reads a message. So Alice sends **two bits by handing
over just one qubit**.

**Does Bob always read exactly the message Alice sent, and never another?**

## Quantum, with true and false

This example uses *discrete quantum theory*: a simplified version of quantum
mechanics in which the weights of a quantum state are not complex numbers but
just 0 or 1, added so that 1 + 1 = 0.

It keeps the key quantum effect, *interference*: two ways of reaching the
same result can cancel out. Here that becomes a simple rule:

> An outcome happens if it can be reached in an **odd** number of ways.
> Two ways cancel; one way, or three, survive.

So computing in this theory is ordinary rule-following plus counting.

## What we tell eyemind

The program starts with small tables of facts, numbered 1 to 17 (most are
left out here):

```js
// |R) = |0, 0) + |1, 1)
fact(r('false', 'false'))
fact(r('true', 'true'))
// … the states S, U and V (facts 3–10)

// G |0) = |1)
fact(g('false', 'true'))
// G |1) = |0)
fact(g('true', 'false'))
// … the operations ID and K (facts 11, 12 and 15–17)
```

`'false'` and `'true'` stand for the qubit values 0 and 1. A state with
several terms is a *superposition*: the shared pair `r` is "both 0, plus both
1", one fact per term. The operations are written as tables from input to
output: `g` flips a qubit; `id` leaves it alone; `k` maps 1 to "0 plus 1".

Then the protocol, as rules 18 to 35:

```js
// … the combined operations KG and GK (rules 18–19)
// Alice's encoding: message 0, 1, 2 or 3 applies ID, G, K or KG to her qubit.
implied_by(alice(0, [X, Y]), id(X, Y))
// … alice for messages 1–3 (rules 21–23), Bob's four readings (24–27)

implied_by(path(N, M, [X, Y, B]), [r(X, Y), alice(N, [X, B]), bob([B, Y], M)])

fact(message(0))
fact(message(1))
fact(message(2))
fact(message(3))

// odd(List): the list has an odd number of elements.
fact(odd([_]))
implied_by(odd([_, _, ...T]), odd(T))

implies(
  [message(N), message(M), findall(Path, path(N, M, Path), Paths), odd(Paths)],
  sdcoding(N, M),
)

// which messages arrive as which
query(sdcoding(_, _))
```

Capitalized names are **variables**, blanks that stand for whatever fits; a
lone `_` is a blank nobody cares about. Square brackets hold a list, or, as
the condition of a rule, several conditions that must *all* hold.

- `implied_by(conclusion, condition)` is a **backward rule**, used on demand.
  Rule 28 says what one `path` is: one way for Alice's message `N` to reach
  Bob as reading `M`. It goes through a term `X, Y` of the shared pair, her
  operation turning her half `X` into `B`, and his reading of `B` and `Y`.
  The way is recorded as the list `[X, Y, B]`.
- `odd` (facts 33 and rule 34): a list of one item is odd; dropping two items
  keeps a list odd.
- `implies(premise, conclusion)` is a **forward rule** (rule 35). Its
  premise uses `findall(Path, path(N, M, Path), Paths)`: *collect every
  `Path` that is a way from `N` to `M` into the list `Paths`*. If that list
  has an odd length, message `N` arrives as `M`.

---

## What eyemind concludes

```js
// Answers: each instance of a query() that holds.
sdcoding(0, 0)
sdcoding(1, 1)
sdcoding(2, 2)
sdcoding(3, 3)
```

Every message arrives as itself, and no message arrives as anything else.

The cancellation is what makes this work. Message 0 reaches reading 0 by one
way, but readings 1 and 3 by two ways each, which cancel, and reading 2 by
none.

---

## The proof, line by line

`eyemind --proof` writes down how it reached each answer. This is the
complete proof:

```js
// Answers: each instance of a query() that holds.
sdcoding(0, 0)
sdcoding(1, 1)
sdcoding(2, 2)
sdcoding(3, 3)

// Clauses: the program clauses the steps cite, by clause number.
clause(29, fact(message(0)))
clause(30, fact(message(1)))
clause(31, fact(message(2)))
clause(32, fact(message(3)))
clause(33, fact(odd([_0])))
clause(35, implies([message(N), message(M), findall(Path, path(N, M, Path), Paths), odd(Paths)], sdcoding(N, M)))

// Steps: each goal, what justifies it (a clause, a builtin, a control, an
// absence or a collection), the bindings and the goals it uses.
step(sdcoding(0, 0), clause(35), {N: 0, M: 0, Path: A, Paths: [['true', 'true', 'true']]}, [message(0), message(0), findall(A, path(0, 0, A), [['true', 'true', 'true']]), odd([['true', 'true', 'true']])])
step(message(0), clause(29), {}, [])
step(findall(A, path(0, 0, A), [['true', 'true', 'true']]), 'collected', {}, [])
step(odd([['true', 'true', 'true']]), clause(33), {_0: ['true', 'true', 'true']}, [])
step(sdcoding(1, 1), clause(35), {N: 1, M: 1, Path: A, Paths: [['false', 'false', 'true']]}, [message(1), message(1), findall(A, path(1, 1, A), [['false', 'false', 'true']]), odd([['false', 'false', 'true']])])

step(sdcoding(2, 2), clause(35), {N: 2, M: 2, Path: A, Paths: [['true', 'true', 'false']]}, [message(2), message(2), findall(A, path(2, 2, A), [['true', 'true', 'false']]), odd([['true', 'true', 'false']])])
step(message(2), clause(31), {}, [])
step(findall(A, path(2, 2, A), [['true', 'true', 'false']]), 'collected', {}, [])
step(odd([['true', 'true', 'false']]), clause(33), {_0: ['true', 'true', 'false']}, [])
step(sdcoding(3, 3), clause(35), {N: 3, M: 3, Path: A, Paths: [['false', 'false', 'false']]}, [message(3), message(3), findall(A, path(3, 3, A), [['false', 'false', 'false']]), odd([['false', 'false', 'false']])])
step(message(3), clause(32), {}, [])
step(findall(A, path(3, 3, A), [['false', 'false', 'false']]), 'collected', {}, [])
step(odd([['false', 'false', 'false']]), clause(33), {_0: ['false', 'false', 'false']}, [])

// Search certificate: derived facts and complete answers used to check
// negations, collections and the original questions.
searched(path(0, 0, B), [path(0, 0, ['true', 'true', 'true'])])
searched(alice(0, ['false', C]), [alice(0, ['false', 'false'])])
searched(bob(['false', 'false'], 0), [])
searched(gk('false', 'false'), [])
searched(alice(0, ['true', C]), [alice(0, ['true', 'true'])])
searched(bob(['true', 'true'], 0), [bob(['true', 'true'], 0)])
searched(gk('true', 'true'), [gk('true', 'true')])
searched(path(1, 1, D), [path(1, 1, ['false', 'false', 'true'])])
searched(alice(1, ['false', E]), [alice(1, ['false', 'true'])])
searched(bob(['true', 'false'], 1), [bob(['true', 'false'], 1)])
searched(alice(1, ['true', E]), [alice(1, ['true', 'false'])])
searched(bob(['false', 'true'], 1), [])
searched(path(2, 2, F), [path(2, 2, ['true', 'true', 'false'])])
searched(alice(2, ['false', G]), [alice(2, ['false', 'false'])])
searched(bob(['false', 'false'], 2), [])
searched(alice(2, ['true', G]), [alice(2, ['true', 'false']), alice(2, ['true', 'true'])])
searched(bob(['false', 'true'], 2), [bob(['false', 'true'], 2)])
searched(bob(['true', 'true'], 2), [])
searched(path(3, 3, H), [path(3, 3, ['false', 'false', 'false'])])
searched(alice(3, ['false', I]), [alice(3, ['false', 'false']), alice(3, ['false', 'true'])])
searched(kg('false', J), [kg('false', 'false'), kg('false', 'true')])
searched(bob(['false', 'false'], 3), [bob(['false', 'false'], 3)])
searched(bob(['true', 'false'], 3), [])
searched(alice(3, ['true', I]), [alice(3, ['true', 'false'])])
searched(kg('true', K), [kg('true', 'false')])
searched(bob(['false', 'true'], 3), [])
```

It has three parts:

- **The claims**: the four answers.
- **The clauses**: the program lines the steps cite, by their number: the
  four messages (29–32), the odd fact (33) and the forward rule (35). The
  `_` of fact 33 is shown as `_0` so a step can name it.
- **The steps**: one per thing established. A step reads
  `step(what, by which clause, with which values, using what)`.
- **The search certificate**: every search that the four collections made,
  each written `searched(call, answers)` with every answer it gave, in the
  order the calls were first met.

Read the steps for message 0 as sentences:

1. *Message 0 arrives as 0*: by rule 35 with `N` = 0, `M` = 0 and `Paths` =
   a list of one way, `[['true', 'true', 'true']]`, because 0 is a message
   (twice, as sender's and as reader's message), the list of all ways from 0
   to 0 is that list, and it is odd. (`Path: A` just says the collecting
   variable stays a blank.)
2. *0 is a message*: fact 29.
3. *All the ways from 0 to 0 are `[['true', 'true', 'true']]`*: justified as
   `'collected'`. This step is not derived from the program within the
   proof. eyemind ran the search and recorded the resulting list, and the
   search certificate records the search itself, so the checker can confirm
   that these are the ways, and that there are no others.
4. *A list of one item is odd*: fact 33, with `_0` = the one way.

Steps 5–8, 9–12 and 13–16 say the same for messages 1, 2 and 3, each with
exactly one way: `['false', 'false', 'true']`, `['true', 'true', 'false']`
and `['false', 'false', 'false']`.

The certificate's first seven lines are the search behind step 3. The way
from 0 to 0 needs a shared pair `[X, Y]`, Alice's operation for message 0
on X, and Bob's reading 0 of the result. With X false, Alice gives
`['false', 'false']`, but Bob cannot read `['false', 'false']` as 0
(`gk('false', 'false')` has no answers). With X true, Alice gives
`['true', 'true']`, and Bob does read that as 0. So the search gives
exactly one way, `path(0, 0, ['true', 'true', 'true'])`. The other lines do
the same for messages 1, 2 and 3. No `derived` line is needed: no forward
rule concludes anything these searches consult.

## Checked: what the report says

A proof is only worth something if someone else can check it. `eyemind -c`
generates the proof and checks it against the program; `--check-proof` checks
a saved proof. The checker never reasons by itself: it only confirms each step
against the program. This is the complete report:

```js
// Answers checked subject to the obligations below.
sdcoding(0, 0)
sdcoding(1, 1)
sdcoding(2, 2)
sdcoding(3, 3)

// C1-C10: resolution, acyclicity, justification, coverage, re-decision,
// boundary consistency, relevance, witness integrity, search closure and call fidelity.
condition('C1', 'resolution', 'ok', 12)
condition('C2', 'well_founded', 'ok', 16)
condition('C3', 'justification', 'ok', 16)
condition('C4', 'coverage', 'ok', 20)
condition('C5', 're_decision', 'ok', 0)
condition('C6', 'boundary_consistency', 'ok', 0)
condition('C7', 'relevance', 'ok', 20)
condition('C8', 'witness_integrity', 'ok', 0)
condition('C9', 'search_closure', 'ok', 4)
condition('C10', 'call_fidelity', 'ok', 0)

// Obligations: absence, collection, original-call or all-answers evidence remains unproved.
obligation('call_fidelity', 'original_call', sdcoding(0, 0))
obligation('call_fidelity', 'original_call', sdcoding(1, 1))
obligation('call_fidelity', 'original_call', sdcoding(2, 2))
obligation('call_fidelity', 'original_call', sdcoding(3, 3))
obligation('call_fidelity', 'all_answers', sdcoding(A, B))

// Proof statistics: recorded steps and how they were checked.
steps(16)
verified(12)
recomputed(0)
composed(0)
trusted(5)
claims(4)

// This verdict applies to the claims above; it does not establish that they are every answer.
verdict('checked_with_obligations')
```

Each `condition` line names a check, says `'ok'`, and counts what it looked
at:

- **C1 resolution (12)**: the 12 steps that cite a program line really are
  instances of it. Step 1 is rule 35 with `N` = 0 and `M` = 0.
- **C2 well-founded (16)**: none of the 16 steps depends on itself, even
  indirectly.
- **C3 justification (16)**: every step says how it was justified, in a form
  the checker understands. The 4 `'collected'` steps, as required, have no
  values and use nothing.
- **C4 coverage (20)**: the 4 answers and the 16 things the steps use are
  each backed by a step.
- **C5 re-decision (0)**: no arithmetic or other built-in calculation needed
  recomputing.
- **C6 boundary consistency (0)**: no boundary was left to the evidence:
  C9 settled all four collections.
- **C7 relevance (20)**: the 4 claims answer the question, and all 16 steps
  serve them.
- **C8 witness integrity (0)**: no rule invented a new, unnamed thing, so
  there is no invented name to verify.
- **C9 search closure (4)**: the 4 collected lists were settled by the
  search certificate: each list holds exactly the ways the searches found,
  in the same order.

The collections are settled by their search certificates. The checker verifies each `searched` line
without searching itself: it expands the call one level against the
program, as a search would, and answers every inner call from that call's
own line, or from the facts when only facts define the relation. So no line
vouches for itself, and a list with a way missing or added would disagree
with the expansion and fail the check. That matters here more than usual: a
single missing or extra way would flip an odd count to even, and the answer
would change. "All the ways" means all within this program. The
statistics: 16 steps, 12 verified against the program and the 4
collections settled by the certificate, no boundary steps trusted, for 4 claims.

The verdict is **checked with obligations**: each answer follows from the program. The verdict also does not establish
completeness: that no message arrives as a *different* one rests on eyemind's
own search, which the proof does not record.

C10 leaves 4 original-call claims and the answers of 1 question unproved by the available evidence. The
verdict is **checked with obligations**: the recorded derivations are
conditional on these call-fidelity obligations. `--strict-proof` rejects
them. The report does not establish answer completeness.

## Try it

```sh
eyemind examples/superdense-coding.js                          # the answers
eyemind --proof examples/superdense-coding.js                  # answers with their proof
eyemind --goal "path(0, M, P)" examples/superdense-coding.js   # every way for message 0
```

The last lists every way message 0 can travel: one to reading 0, two to
reading 1, two to reading 3. Or open it in the
[playground](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyemind/playground/#example=superdense-coding).

Switch off interference: replace `odd(Paths)` in rule 35 with
`not_identical(Paths, [])`, so any way at all counts. Now 14 of the 16
message-reading pairs come out, and Bob can no longer tell the messages
apart. Or delete the fact `r('true', 'true')`, so the two qubits are no
longer entangled: the four correct pairs give way to ten mixed-up ones, and
1 → 1 and 3 → 3 are the only messages still read as themselves.

Its sibling, [teleportation.js](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eyemind/blob/main/examples/teleportation.js), runs the companion
protocol, quantum teleportation, in the same theory with the same relations.

---

## Takeaway

Quantum interference can be expressed as ordinary rules plus one twist:
count the ways, keep the odd ones. eyemind shows each answer's ways, and its
search certificate lets the checker confirm that these are all the ways.
