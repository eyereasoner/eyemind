// One language for everything. This program states an energy grant policy,

// check report back as ordinary facts, in the same language, to answer audit
// questions about the reasoning itself: which data each decision rests on,
// which absences it assumes, and which decisions are at risk if
// self-declared data is wrong. There is no export format, no schema and no
// second tool: rules, data, conclusions, proofs and reports are all terms.
//
// ann, cara and dan get a grant, ann and dan also a top-up for a household of
// three or more, bob is refused for his income, and eve gets nothing because
// she already received a grant. The checker confirms each grant's absence of
// an earlier grant from the already_received facts. Call fidelity remains an
// explicit obligation for these forward policy rules. The decisions for
// cara and dan are at risk, because their incomes are self-declared. It shows
// the library API (eyemind.build, run and readTerms) used inside a program,
// and proofs read back as ordinary data.

// The applications, as JavaScript data: name, monthly income, household size
// and the evidence for the income. JavaScript computes clauses from them;
// once stated, a clause is a term.
