// Illustrative naive Bayes diagnosis of a printer that shows a paper jam and is
// offline. Three possible faults each have a prior probability and a
// probability of producing each of the two observations; the numbers are
// invented. A fault's weight is the product of its prior and both likelihoods,
// and its posterior probability is its weight divided by the sum of all
// weights, which assumes the faults are the only alternatives and the two
// observations are independent given the fault.
//
// The program concludes that a paper jam is the most likely fault (about
// 0.48), then network loss (0.38) and power loss (0.13). Weights are whole
// percentages, so the products stay exact integers until the final division.
// It shows forward rules, a collection with findall_sorted, and a recursive sum.

// fault(Name, Prior, P(jam | fault), P(offline | fault)), all in percent.
